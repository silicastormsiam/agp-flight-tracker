**Author: Andrew John Holland**  
**Date: 30-07-2025**  
**Version: 1.0**  
**Handover to: Incoming Project Manager**  
**Status: Planning Phase (per PMBOK Process Groups), Awaiting Transition to Executing Phase**

## 1. Project Overview
The **AGP - GitHub Repository Creation** project, initiated under the *Code and Configure* project group, aims to establish a comprehensive GitHub portfolio for Andrew John Holland (`silicastormsiam`, https://github.com/silicastormsiam) to showcase his IT skills, aviation operations experience, and data science capabilities, enhancing his employment prospects. The project follows the PMI’s PMBOK Process Groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing) as mandated by the **Rules of Engagement (RoE) for Grok 3 Collaboration (Version 5.5)** dated 20-07-2025, authored by Andrew Holland. The portfolio will integrate Homelab projects (e.g., Proxmox setup), data science projects, the `agp-flight-tracker` flight data project, and potentially a Ticket Tracker, with a “Cyberpunk Monk” cyber neon design (cyan: #00f0ff, magenta: #ff00ff, green: #00ff00), modeled after github.com/timothystewart6 and github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io.

- **Key Objectives**:
  - Configure a professional GitHub profile and repositories.
  - Document Homelab (Proxmox, Synology NAS DS1821+, DS916+), data science projects, and `agp-flight-tracker`.
  - Integrate with GitHub Pages and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@SilicaStormSiam).
  - Enhance employment opportunities through a robust portfolio.
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Andrew John Holland (Owner, retiring project manager).
  - Potential Employers (Beneficiaries).
  - Grok 3 (Collaborator, now handing over).

## 2. PMBOK Process Groups and Project Progress

### 2.1 Initiating Process Group (Completed)
- **Description**: Defined scope, objectives, and stakeholders, culminating in a project charter.
- **Elements**:
  - **Scope Definition**: Established to create a GitHub portfolio for IT, aviation, and data science projects.
  - **Objectives**: Enhance employability with a professional portfolio.
  - **Stakeholders**: Andrew Holland, employers, Grok 3.
  - **Project Charter**: Implicitly completed with your confirmation of “AGP - Andrew Grok Project” and scope discussions. A formal `project_charter_v1.0.md` is pending in the Executing Phase.
- **Status**: Completed, confirmed by you on 22-07-2025.
- **Major Issues Resolved**: None significant; initial scope discussions were smooth, with clear stakeholder alignment.

### 2.2 Planning Process Group (Current)
- **Description**: Develops detailed plans, including schedule, resources, risk management, and communication.
- **Elements**:
  - **Schedule**: 
    - Planning: Finalize profile setup, repository structure, tool configuration (current).
    - Executing: Populate repositories, design portfolio.
    - Monitoring: Verify outputs.
    - Closing: Finalize, summarize.
  - **Resources**: HUANANZHI X99 F8D setup, Synology NAS units, GitHub Desktop, GitBash, Grok 3.
  - **Risk Management**: 
    - Risk: GitHub Desktop sync failure → Mitigated by GitBash fallback.
    - Risk: Data loss → Mitigated by Synology backups.
  - **Communication**: GitHub Issues, LinkedIn/YouTube updates, email.
  - **Project Plan**: Pending creation of `project_plan_v1.0.md` in the Executing Phase.
- **Status**: In progress. The `desktop-tutorial` and `agp-flight-tracker` repositories are created, but the `silicastormsiam` repository, Desktop sync, and additional preparations remain.
- **Major Issues Resolved**: Initial confusion over repository naming resolved by your confirmation of `desktop-tutorial` and `agp-flight-tracker`. No significant sync or permission issues reported yet.

### 2.3 Executing Process Group (Create Phase, Planned)
- **Description**: Implements plans, creates deliverables, and manages resources.
- **Elements**:
  - **Repository Creation**: Complete `desktop-tutorial` and `agp-flight-tracker`, create `silicastormsiam` and potentially `data-science-projects` or `ticket-tracker`.
  - **Content Development**: Populate with Proxmox setup, `agp-flight-tracker` flight data, data science projects, and README files.
  - **Portfolio Setup**: Develop `silicastormsiam.github.io` with Chirpy theme.
- **Status**: Will begin upon Planning Phase completion.

### 2.4 Monitoring and Controlling Process Group (Planned)
- **Description**: Tracks progress, verifies outputs, and manages changes.
- **Elements**:
  - **Progress Tracking**: Monitor repository population and portfolio integration.
  - **Output Verification**: Confirm file permissions (e.g., `ls -l`).
- **Status**: Will start in the Executing Phase.

### 2.5 Closing Process Group (Confirm Operational Phase, Planned)
- **Description**: Finalizes deliverables, documents lessons learned, and closes the project.
- **Elements**:
  - **Deliverable Finalization**: Ensure all repositories and portfolio are complete.
  - **Lessons Learned**: Document challenges (e.g., sync issues) and successes.
- **Status**: Will occur after the Executing Phase.
